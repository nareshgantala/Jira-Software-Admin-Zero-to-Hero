## What is Jira Software?

### Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on Jira Software! This material aims to simplify Jira Software and help you and your team manage work more efficiently. Let's dive in!

### What is Jira Software?

**Jira Software** is a tool designed to help teams manage their work. Think of it as a collaborative to-do list for your entire team, allowing you to plan, track, and deliver projects efficiently. It's the most widely used Jira product, suitable for teams of any size and type, from Agile and software development teams to marketing groups.

### Benefits of Using Jira

Using Jira Software can enhance your team's transparency, efficiency, and collaboration. Here’s how:

1. **Transparency**: Everyone on the team can see what tasks are being worked on.
2. **Efficiency**: Plan your work schedule effectively, knowing when tasks start and end.
3. **Collaboration**: Keep team discussions and feedback organized and in one place.

### How Jira Helps You

In addition to improving teamwork, Jira can also help you excel in your individual role:

1. **Prioritize Important Tasks**: Focus on what’s most important.
2. **Boost Productivity**: Complete tasks more efficiently.
3. **Plan Ahead**: Visualize your upcoming tasks and deadlines.
4. **Get and Share Information**: Easily ask questions and find answers related to your tasks.
5. **Stay Updated**: Keep track of your team's progress and updates.

### Jira Software Roles

There are two main roles in Jira Software: users and admins.

#### Jira Software User

As a user, you'll track and manage your daily tasks. Here’s what users typically do:

- Update and manage assigned tasks.
- Share progress with the team.
- Monitor the team’s progress and give feedback.

#### Jira Software Admin

Admins set up and configure Jira for the team. Here’s what admins usually handle:

- Customize layouts, features, and permissions.
- Allocate resources based on team capacity.
- Prioritize tasks across different projects.
- Create reports to monitor team performance.

### Jira Software Projects

#### What is a Jira Software Project?

A project in Jira is a collection of issues. Every single issue is attached to a project, and projects organize issues in whichever way your team prefers.

#### Identifying Your Projects

To identify your projects and see their names, look at the top left of your screen under the Jira logo to see the current project name. To see all your projects, find the main navigation bar and click the "Projects" dropdown, which shows a list of all projects you have access to view.

#### How Projects are Named

Project names can be based on teams or larger deliverables. Examples include "Game Design Team" or "Vidzi App Release V2.7." Knowing your project names helps you understand how work is structured.

#### Project Keys

Project keys are short versions of the project name that help identify the issues in that project. For example, if the project key for your Game Design Team project is GDT, issues within that project will be labeled GDT-1, GDT-2, and so on.

#### Types of Projects

There are two types of projects in Jira Software:
1. **Team-managed projects**: Ideal for smaller, independent teams that want to control their own working processes.
2. **Company-managed projects**: Suitable for larger organizations with more complex workflows.

### Jira Software Boards

#### What is a Jira Software Board?

A board is a visual display of work progress. Boards typically have three to four columns such as To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done. Teams move issue cards across the board as work progresses.

#### Types of Boards

1. **Kanban Boards**: Used by all types of teams to illustrate a continuous flow of work. Issues move in and out of the board from the start until the end of the project.
2. **Scrum Boards**: Mostly used by agile software development teams. Scrum boards bring in groups of issues that the team will attempt to complete during a fixed period, often a two-week sprint.

#### Naming Boards

Boards sit within projects and often have specific names based on a larger deliverable or team. For example, within the "Game Design Team" project, the board could be named "Farm Harvest (Video Game)."

#### Seeing All of Your Boards

Each Jira project can have multiple boards. To see all your boards, navigate to the left project sidebar and select the board dropdown.

### Summary

In summary, Jira Software is a powerful tool for managing team tasks, enhancing transparency, efficiency, and collaboration. It helps you prioritize, plan, and stay informed about your work and your team's progress.
